Biological systems are variable, and we consequently need statistical methods to cope with this variability in drawing valid inferences from our data. As a consequence of this variability, we can never say anything with *absolute* certainty based on biological data: there will always be some “doubt” due to **chance variation**. Not surprisingly, we need the tools and language of probability to assist us with quantifying our level of “doubt” when we make our conclusions.

We won't deal with probability theory to any great degree in this unit of study, but just outline some of the key HSC Maths concepts that we will build on.

## Probability

The probability of an event is the proportion of times that the event occurs in a large number of repeated trials. For example, if we toss a coin 100 times, we would expect to get 50 heads and 50 tails. The probability of getting a head is therefore 0.5.

The equation for probability is:

$$ P(E) = \frac{\text{number of times event E occurs}}{\text{total number of trials}} $$ where $P(E)$ is the probability of event $E$. Where $P(E) = 0$ the event is impossible, and where $P(E) = 1$ the event is certain (must happen).
